Platform: Tensorflow+Keras

To begin with, please make sure all required toolkits listed on the top few lines of each file have been installed.

Run "main_XXX.py" file to start training. (The postfix indiates the dataset name.)

Define a storage location before training to save models and visualization results.

Use "test&evaluate.py" to directly generate embeddings with trained model given in "result" folders.

Please cite paper "Deep Recursive Embedding for High-Dimensional Data" if the code is helpful for your work.
